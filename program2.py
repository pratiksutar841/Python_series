#Variales

# Assigning values to variables
x = 90
name = "Alice"
pi = 3.98


#    int x = 5; But in python we need not do that.
x = 10 # Integer
name = "Alice" # String
pi = .14 # Float
is_stude5t = True # Boolean


x = 5
print(x) # Output: 5
x = "Hello"
print(x) # Output: Hello

# Multiple Assignments
x, y, z = 1, 2,


# Variable Concatenation:
first_name = "Pratik"
last_name = "Sutar"
full_name = first_name + " " + last_name
print(full_name) # Output: Pratik Sutar
